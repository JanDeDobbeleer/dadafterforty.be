Right. Now that we've [gotten this show on the road][post-1], the time has come to get started. When I had the idea to get back into shape for real, I was looking at losing about 12kg of I managed to acquire the past 8 years. Changes to my active life, a bit due to work-life balance, or by not committing to a healthy lifestyle anymore and then eventually _becoming a father_ and losing track of basically everything else (with good reason), made sure I was slowly but surely gaining a bit of weight. The funny thing is, as it's a gradual process, you don't realize this until you see an old picture of yourself next to a more recent one. And yes, we could go into detail on how that usually triggers ones _midlife crisis_, but more on that in a later post[^1]. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Don't worry though, you've reached the point of return. You can't travel back in time (yet), so where do we start then? Well, before considering anything else, make sure you know and control what you're eating. As it's hard to change habits, we will need some help in visualizing what we're consuming and help us stay on track. The way I've done this is by _simply_ logging my calorie intake. An average male should consume about 2000 calories per day to stay alive, although I'm challenging that one if you're having a desk job (based on personal experience). But for the sake of convenience, let's go with the standard.

So, what can you use to log your intake? When it comes to apps, there's multiple options out there and most of them are available on all platforms (iOS - Android, sorry Windows Phone ‚ò†). To save you from the trouble of going through them all or knowing what you're looking for as features, allow me to assist.

What are we looking for feature wise?

-   Have a large dataset
-   Allow to plan ahead
-   Share recipes and meals

### Large dataset

Initially, tracking what you're eating is a bit of a burden, so you want to go for the platform that has the richest data set available. I tried to do this a few times before succeeding in making a habit out of it and trust me, it's hard. Being able to scan a barcode and add food easily is bliss considering we're always busy either at work or at home. Depending on where you're from, it might as well be app A has better options for local food vs app B, personally I found using [MyFitnessPal][myfitnesspal] and [Lose It][loseit] provided the best possible results, with [MyFitnessPal][myfitnesspal] in the lead.

### Plan ahead

When the habit of logging food is kicking in, you will want to gain time and plan. The most straightforward use-case would be to plan lunch and dinner when you're entering your breakfast as it will free up time during the busiest periods of the day. Lunch, as you're at work and well, you might not always have time to go about it in a relaxed fashion, and dinner because depending on the age of your kids, _they are the ones that will require all the attention_, not your phone (as it should). Doing this will also force you to either bring your own food, or consciously decide on what to get. Not doing so will most likely result in less healthy habits.

Another one I frequently use is to plan the next day(s) for when I have my recipes and dinner plans available. Suppose there are some left-overs from dinner and you will take them to work the next day, you probably won't remember the exact weight or calories by that time so entering this information when it's fresh in mind is a lot easier (and once again, saves time the next day).

Knowing what's still to come can also provide some relief as you can comfortably spend the remaining calories without having to resort to starving near the end of the day. This is especially useful at the start of your diet when consumption tends to drop rather drastically. Use case 1 is supported by every app out there, for the second one I think only [MyFitnessPal][myfitnesspal] allows to do so on the free plan.

### Sharing is caring

Do not underestimate this one. I can (and will) dedicate an entire post on how having people in your life supporting and participating in your choice to develop a healthier lifestyle, so the ability to share recipes and meals makes life easier. Right now, I made it a habit to make dinner, create a recipe while I'm doing so and immediately share this with my girlfriend. _We are both committed_ to doing this, so we never have to guess what's on our plate, we know. Even if you start out by yourself, you do not want to switch to a new app and lose your progress (we all love this, it keeps us motivated), so choose wisely. Both [MyFitnessPal][myfitnesspal] and [Lose It][loseit] support this, so yay.

In conclusion, for me, only [MyFitnessPal][myfitnesspal] ticks all the boxes if you do not want to pay extra for every _required_ feature. But I probably never tried all of them so if you have experience with an app that can do all of this as well and you like it, get in touch. I'm always down to try something new üëç.
